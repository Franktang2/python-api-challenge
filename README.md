# Python API Challenge


## Background

Used Python, Matplotlib, Citipy, the OpenWeatherMapAPI, the Google Places API to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator.


## WeatherPy

Created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distances from the equator. 
Using the numpy package, it was generated a random set of at least 500 latitude and longitude coordinates and used a package called Citipy to identify the nearest city for each latitude and longitude pair. 
Afterwards, I mande API calls to the OpenWeatherMap API to get weather data for each of the cities. 

Using the data from the OpenWeatherMap API, I built a series of scatter plots to visualize the following relationships:

-Temperature (F) vs. Latitude

-Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

-Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

-Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude



## Technologies Used

-Python

-Pandas library

-Jupyter Notebook

-Matplotlib library

-Citipy (will need to be installed in your anaconda environment)

-OpenWeatherMap API

-Google Places API
